This is a Voice Assistant made using Python.

You can start by cloning this repository.
After that, you must create a .env file and within it you have to place your groq api key and weather api key from the open weather.
 Example:
      GROQ_API_KEY = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
      WEATHER_API_KEY = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"

Then you can go to the file, main.py and run the voice assistant.
